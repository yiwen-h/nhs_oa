Long segments of spinal cord inflammation (myelitis), severe optic neuritis, and/or bouts of intractable vomiting and hiccoughs (area postrema syndrome) are classic presentations of the disease and may alert the clinician to the diagnosis. Untreated, approximately 50% of NMOSD patients will be wheelchair users and blind, and a third will have died within 5 years of their first attack. Unlike multiple sclerosis, a progressive clinical course is very unusual and the accrual of disability is related to relapses. Approximately 75% of patients have antibodies against aquaporin-4, a water channel expressed on astrocytes. Relapses are treated aggressively to prevent residual disability with high-dose steroids and often plasma exchange. Relapse prevention is crucial and achieved with long-term immunosuppression. In this article we review the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and management of NMOSD."

It is useful to review this topic in light of recent discoveries of the genetic mutations that now define primary erythromelalgia, as opposed to secondary erythromelalgia, which is often associated with underlying medical disorders."

Corneal neovascularization is a sight-threatening condition affecting more than 1.4 million people per year. Left untreated, it can lead to tissue scarring, oedema, lipid deposition, and persistent inflammation that may significantly affect visual prognosis and quality of life. The aim was to review the recent evidence relating to the pathophysiology, investigations and management of corneal neovascularization. Methods. Literature review of prospective and retrospective studies, clinical trials and animal models relating to the pathophysiology, investigation and management of corneal neovascularization. Results. Corneal neovascularization is characterized by the invasion of new blood vessels into the cornea caused by an imbalance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors that preserve corneal transparency as a result of various ocular insults and hypoxic injuries. Risk factors that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease include contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, trauma, previous surgery and herpes. The results highlighted the current and future management modalities of corneal neovascularization, which includes corneal transplantation, laser - phototherapy, injections and topical treatment. Conclusion. The future of corneal neovascularization is promising and this paper discusses the upcoming revolution in local gene therapy. Abbreviations.

Most have early stage MF with localised patches and plaques, which has a favourable survival outcome, but nearly a quarter progress to late stage with tumours, erythroderma, and systemic involvement. Management is based on stage directed treatment with early stage MF (IA-IIA) using skin directed therapies (SDTs), including topical corticosteroids (TCS), chlormethine or retinoids, phototherapy, and radiotherapy (localised or total skin electron beam therapy). Advanced stages (IIB-IVB) or refractory MF often requires systemic treatments which may be used in combination with SDTs. These are primarily employed as a palliative approach, aiming to provide symptomatic relief. For advanced patients achieving a complete or near complete response (CR) with a good performance status may be considered for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. This paper reviews the different SDT modalities and their efficacy in MF management."

Survivors are disabled. Management involves medical treatment, with or without decompressive hemicraniectomy and later duraplasty. This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether surgery is worthwhile with particular regard to views on quality of life of professionals and patients.METHODS: A Medline search was performed with the search terms ""decompressive surgery,"" ""craniectomy,"" ""hemicraniectomy,"" ""decompressive hemicraniectomy,"" and ""middle cerebral artery,"" ""MCA,"" ""infarct,*"" ""stroke,*"" ""embolus,"" ""emboli,"" ""thrombosis,"" ""occlusion,"" ""infarction,"" and ""middle cerebral artery stroke,"" A second search was also done for views on postoperative quality of life. Studies retrieved were randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and reviews. We compared patients who received only medical treatment with those who had decompressive surgery. Participants were adult patients presenting with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction.RESULTS: 270 abstracts were reviewed. 40 articles were identified: 8 randomized controlled trials and 4 observational studies. There were a total of 692 patients: 268 surgical and 424 medical. The 2 groups were comparable, with similar demographics. In most trials, mortality was lower with surgery. However, morbidity tended to be higher, particularly in the elderly population. Morbidity was lower with medical treatment. Twelve articles on postoperative quality of life were reviewed; views differed between professionals, and survivors and caregivers. A patient-level comparison could not be made between all studies.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical decompression results in lowered mortality but high morbidity, especially in the elderly. There is an increase in Quality Adjusted Life Years but at high costs. Professionals think that surgery is not worth the high disability rate. However, patients and caregivers are satisfied with their postoperative quality of life. Survey data from healthy study participants who are not professionals in stroke care were not available. The decision to treat surgically needs to be decided on an individual basis."
